My name is Patrick but most call me Pat. I have been working with computers since the 1980's. Sometime around 1988 or shortly thereafter, I built my own desktop. It had CGA graphics, 32k RAM, 5MB HD and two 5.25 inch hard drives. At that time there was no internent as we know it today but you could get on line via a modem. My modem was 1200 baud that used a land line to communicate. I have built many systems since then but my current system is an Asus ROG gaming rig. I am not a gamer but bought this system because of its processor (Ryzen 7) and other speedy components like it's RAM and hard drive. It's not as fast as some systems that I have built. I assume this is due to all the bloatware that was included. At some point, I may remove all that and go with a fresh install. So that is enough about me. What's up with you?
